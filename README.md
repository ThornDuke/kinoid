A JavaScript library for generating unique IDs.

## Overview

The **kinoid** library generates unique IDs as strings made up of numbers and the 26 lowercase
characters of the english alphabet; every string generated by kinoid can be considered as a
[base36 number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base36).

The generated IDs are _unique_ because, no matter how many IDs are generated, each ID is different
from all the others generated before or at the same time on the same machine.

### Features

Each ID is composed of a timestamp (representing milliseconds since the UNIX epoch), a number that
identifies the process in which the program runs, and a final number which can be said a
_serialization value_ or a _singularity factor_ that guarantees the uniqueness of the ID.

IDs are sortable by time, because they are based on the time they were created. Additionally, the
time an ID was created can be calculated from the ID itself thanks to the `decodeId()` utility which
returns an object containing, among other things, the date on which that ID was generated.

### Warning

**IDs are not passwords**. Kinoid ensures that each generated ID is _unique_, but not _necessarily
unpredictable_.

This depends on a logical limit that affects _all_ libraries: an algorithm that produces
unpredictable strings cannot guarantee their uniqueness and, vice versa, an algorithm that produces
unique strings cannot guarantee their unpredictability.

If you need a library for creating cryptographically secure passwords, consider
[crypto-pwd-generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crypto-pwd-generator)

## Installation

```bash
# with npm
npm install kinoid

# with yarn
yarn add kinoid
```

## How to use

### using `require`

```javascript
const { newId } = require('kinoid')();

const newBook = {
  title: 'The absence of non-existent unthoughts',
  author: 'John White',
  publisher: 'Hypercubes',
  id: newId(),
};

db.add(newBook);
```

### using `import`

To use this feature, set `"type": "module"` in the `package.json` or use the `.mjs` extension.

```javascript
import kinoid from 'kinoid';
const { newId, decodeId } = kinoid();

const id = newId();

console.log(id);
// cohb4z87mvoyf1zjy

console.log(`The id '${id}' was generated on ${decodeId(id).date.toDateString()}`);
// The id 'cohb4z87mvoyf1zjy' was generated on Tue Nov 19 2024

console.log(decodeId(id));
// {
//   id: 'cohb4z87mvoyf1zjy',
//   date: 2024-11-19T16:52:19.962Z,
//   singularity: 1144,
//   pid: 5438
// }
```
